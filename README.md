IGDB - video game database
https://github.com/igdb/api-android-java

In order to run this project after pulling it down, the developer will need to manually add a few files that are needed for Firebase. These files are not stored with the project for security reasons, and are store in the Firebase console instead. 

First log in to the Firebase console and grab the "google-services.json" from the project, game-swap-production. This file will go in the app/ folder. Then grab the "google-services.json" from the project, game-swap-debug. This file will go in the app/src/debug folder.
